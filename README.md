# Cyberfortress Labs

Cyberfortress Labs is a security-focused research organization dedicated to the design, implementation, and evaluation of modern Security Operations Center (SOC) ecosystems. The organization focuses on integrating SIEM, SOAR, and XDR concepts with practical experimentation and applied research.

The primary objective of Cyberfortress Labs is to explore how open, extensible security architectures combined with intelligent analysis techniques can improve the effectiveness of cyber attack monitoring, detection, and response.



## Research Direction

The research activities of Cyberfortress Labs are centered around the development of an intelligent SOC ecosystem that addresses limitations commonly found in traditional SOC implementations.

Key research directions include:

- Security Operations Center (SOC) architecture and workflows
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)
- Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Open XDR
- Network and host-based detection systems
- Threat intelligence integration
- AI-assisted security analysis and alert prioritization
- Evaluation of detection coverage based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework



## Intelligent SOC Ecosystem Concept

Cyberfortress Labs investigates an intelligent SOC model that combines three core components:

1. **SIEM**  
   Responsible for centralized log collection, normalization, storage, correlation, and alert generation across network, endpoint, and application layers.

2. **SOAR**  
   Manages incident cases, orchestrates security tools, and automates response playbooks to reduce manual analyst workload and response time.

3. **SmartXDR (Proposed Component)**  
   An Open XDR-oriented approach that integrates data from multiple security layers and applies intelligent analysis to:
   - Reduce false positive alerts
   - Prioritize high-severity threats
   - Support analyst decision-making
   - Improve detection and response efficiency

This architecture aims to reduce alert fatigue, shorten Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), and enhance overall SOC effectiveness.



## Experimental Environment

The research environment is implemented as a controlled laboratory setup using virtualized infrastructure. The ecosystem includes, but is not limited to:

- Firewall and routing systems
- Network IDS/IPS and Network Security Monitoring
- Host-based monitoring agents
- Centralized log analytics platform
- Incident response and case management system
- Threat intelligence platforms

The lab is designed to simulate real-world attack scenarios such as brute-force attacks, SQL injection, malware activity, and web-based attacks, enabling systematic evaluation of detection accuracy and response performance.



## Research Goals

The primary goals of Cyberfortress Labs include:

- Designing an intelligent SOC ecosystem integrating SIEM, SOAR, and XDR concepts
- Reducing false positive alerts through intelligent filtering and analysis
- Improving detection and response times via automation
- Evaluating SOC effectiveness using measurable metrics such as MTTD and MTTR
- Assessing detection coverage and attack visibility based on MITRE ATT&CK



## Scope and Limitations

The research conducted within Cyberfortress Labs focuses on proof-of-concept implementation and experimental validation within a simulated environment. The system leverages existing security tools and external AI services without training proprietary machine learning models. Large-scale enterprise deployment and commercial product development are beyond the current research scope.



## Projects

This organization hosts repositories related to:

- SOC and SIEM laboratory deployment
- Detection engineering and attack simulation
- Automation workflows and response playbooks
- Open XDR integration experiments
