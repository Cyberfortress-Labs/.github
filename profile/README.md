</table>

<br>

## 🎯 Research Objectives

- **Intelligent SOC Design** — Integrating SIEM, SOAR, and Open XDR concepts into a cohesive ecosystem
- **Alert Optimization** — Reducing false positives through AI-assisted filtering and prioritization
- **Automated Response** — Improving MTTD and MTTR via orchestrated security workflows
- **Detection Coverage** — Evaluating effectiveness using MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping

<br>

## 🧪 Laboratory Environment

Our controlled experimental infrastructure simulates real-world attack scenarios to validate detection and response capabilities:

- **Network Layer** — Firewall, IDS/IPS, Network Security Monitoring (NSM)
- **Endpoint Layer** — Host-based detection agents and EDR tools
- **Analysis Layer** — Centralized SIEM, threat intelligence platforms, case management
- **Attack Simulation** — Brute-force, SQL injection, malware, web exploits

## 📦 Research Areas

<div align="center">

| Security Domain | Focus Areas |
|:---|:---|
| **Detection Engineering** | MITRE ATT&CK coverage, signature development, behavioral analysis |
| **Threat Intelligence** | IOC integration, threat hunting, intelligence sharing platforms |
| **Automation & Orchestration** | SOAR playbooks, API integration, incident workflows |
| **XDR Research** | Open XDR architecture, cross-layer correlation, unified visibility |
| **AI-Assisted Analysis** | Alert prioritization, anomaly detection, intelligent enrichment |

## ⚠️ Scope & Limitations

This is an **academic research initiative** focused on proof-of-concept implementation and experimental validation in simulated environments. The system leverages existing open-source security tools and external AI services without proprietary ML model training. Large-scale enterprise deployment is outside the current research scope.
