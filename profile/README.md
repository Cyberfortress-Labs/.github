## Hi there

Cyberfortress Labs is a security-focused research and engineering organization dedicated to building and evaluating modern Security Operations Center (SOC) ecosystems.

Our work focuses on the integration of SIEM, SOAR, and XDR concepts with practical experimentation, emphasizing open architectures, detection engineering, and intelligent analysis for monitoring, detection, and response to cyber attacks.



### What we work on

Cyberfortress Labs conducts hands-on research and development in the following areas:

- Security Operations Center (SOC) design and workflows  
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)  
- Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)  
- Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Open XDR  
- Network and host-based detection systems  
- Threat intelligence integration and IOC enrichment  
- AI-assisted alert analysis and prioritization  
- Detection coverage evaluation based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework  



### Contribution guidelines

This organization hosts both research and experimental repositories.

- Public repositories are available for study, experimentation, and reference.
- Contributions, feedback, and discussions are welcome through issues and pull requests where applicable.
- Some repositories are maintained as proof-of-concept or academic experiments and may not follow production-ready standards.

Please refer to individual repository documentation for contribution details.



### Useful resources

- Organization website: https://cyberfortress-labs.github.io/
- Project documentation is provided within each repository.
- Architecture designs, experiment notes, and evaluation results are documented alongside implementation code.

Pinned repositories highlight the primary research components and actively maintained projects.



### Scope and intent

Cyberfortress Labs is primarily a research-oriented environment.

The projects hosted here are designed to explore architectural concepts, detection strategies, and response workflows within controlled laboratory settings. Large-scale enterprise deployment and co
